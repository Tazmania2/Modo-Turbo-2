# Feature Toggle Analysis & Fixes

## Issues Found

### 1. **Feature Toggles Not Saving**
- **Root Cause**: The feature toggle service was using `whiteLabelConfigService` directly instead of making HTTP requests to the API route
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Updated `FeatureToggleService` to use HTTP requests to `/api/admin/features`

### 2. **Branding Service Issues**
- **Root Cause**: Similar to feature toggles, branding service uses direct service calls instead of API routes
- **Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS FIXING** - Should be updated to use HTTP requests

### 3. **Missing Funifier Credentials**
- **Root Cause**: `.env.local` has placeholder values for Funifier credentials
- **Status**: ⚠️ **CONFIGURATION NEEDED** - Real credentials needed for database operations

### 4. **Database Connection Issues**
- **Root Cause**: Without proper Funifier credentials, database operations fail
- **Status**: ✅ **MITIGATED** - Added fallback to return default features when credentials not configured

## What Was Actually Executed

### ✅ Fixed Files:
1. **`src/services/feature-toggle.service.ts`**
   - Updated `getFeatureConfiguration()` to use HTTP GET to `/api/admin/features`
   - Updated `updateMultipleFeatures()` to use HTTP PUT to `/api/admin/features`
   - Updated `resetFeaturesToDefaults()` to use the API

2. **`src/services/simple-feature-storage.service.ts`**
   - Added credential checks to prevent errors when Funifier not configured
   - Added fallback behavior for development/testing

3. **`src/app/api/admin/features/route.ts`**
   - Already properly implemented GET and PUT endpoints
   - Uses `simpleFeatureStorageService` to save to database

### ✅ API Route Structure:
- **GET** `/api/admin/features?instanceId=xxx` - Get current features
- **PUT** `/api/admin/features?instanceId=xxx` - Update features with `{ updates: [...] }`

## Current Status

### Feature Toggles Should Now Work:
1. **Component Flow**: `FeatureTogglePanel` → `FeatureToggleService` → HTTP API → `SimpleFeatureStorageService`
2. **Database**: Saves to `whitelabel__c` collection in Funifier database
3. **Fallback**: Returns default features when Funifier not configured

### To Test Feature Toggles:
1. Go to `/admin` page
2. Toggle any feature switch
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Check browser network tab for API calls to `/api/admin/features`
5. Should see success message if working

## Next Steps Needed

### 1. Configure Funifier Credentials (Optional for Testing)
```bash
# In .env.local, replace with real values:
FUNIFIER_API_KEY=your-real-api-key
FUNIFIER_BASIC_TOKEN=your-real-basic-token
```

### 2. Fix Branding Service (Similar Issue)
The branding service has the same pattern - it should use HTTP requests to branding API routes instead of direct service calls.

### 3. Test the Feature Toggles
- Navigate to admin panel
- Try toggling features
- Check if they save and persist

## Debug Endpoints Created
- `/api/debug/feature-status` - Check credential status and feature loading

## Summary
The feature toggles **should now work** for saving/loading. The main fixes were:
1. ✅ Updated service to use HTTP API calls
2. ✅ Added fallback for missing credentials  
3. ✅ API routes were already properly implemented

The issue was that the service layer was bypassing the API routes entirely.
