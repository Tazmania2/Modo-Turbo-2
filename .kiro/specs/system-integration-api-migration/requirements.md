# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical system integration issues in the white-label gamification platform where internal API calls are not persisting changes, users cannot access the main system from the admin panel, and the system needs to migrate from internal APIs to direct Funifier API integration. The platform should function as a true headless application with direct Funifier connectivity, proper navigation between admin and user interfaces, and removal of mock data outside of demo mode.

## Glossary

- **Funifier_API**: The external Funifier service API that serves as the primary database and gamification engine
- **White_Label_Collection**: The white_label__c collection in Funifier database that stores personalized white-label configurations
- **Admin_Panel**: The administrative interface for managing white-label configurations and system settings
- **User_Dashboard**: The end-user interface showing personal gamification metrics and progress
- **Ranking_System**: The competitive ranking interface showing user positions and leaderboards
- **Internal_API**: The current Next.js API routes that are not properly persisting data
- **Demo_Mode**: A system state that uses mock data for demonstration purposes
- **Headless_Architecture**: A system design where the backend API is separate from the frontend presentation layer

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Direct Funifier API Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to use direct Funifier API calls for ALL data operations instead of internal API routes, so that all data changes are properly persisted and synchronized with the Funifier backend.

1. WHEN the system makes any data requests, THE System SHALL call Funifier APIs directly from the frontend components
2. WHEN user data is modified, THE System SHALL send changes directly to Funifier endpoints to ensure persistence
3. WHEN ranking data is fetched, THE System SHALL retrieve information directly from Funifier ranking APIs
4. WHEN white-label configurations are accessed, THE System SHALL fetch and store them in the white_label__c collection via Funifier database API
5. WHEN dashboard data is requested, THE System SHALL retrieve all user metrics, goals, and gamification data directly from Funifier APIs
6. WHEN admin configurations are saved, THE System SHALL store them in appropriate Funifier database collections via direct API calls
7. WHEN the system initializes, THE System SHALL establish direct authentication with Funifier services

### Requirement 2: Admin to User System Navigation

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to navigate from the admin panel to the user dashboard and ranking system, so that I can view and test the end-user experience while maintaining my administrative privileges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin panel, THE System SHALL provide navigation options to access user dashboard and ranking views
2. WHEN an admin navigates to /dashboard, THE System SHALL display the user dashboard interface without requiring separate login
3. WHEN an admin accesses /ranking, THE System SHALL show the ranking system with full functionality
4. WHEN an admin is viewing user interfaces, THE System SHALL maintain admin session and provide option to return to admin panel
5. WHEN navigation occurs between admin and user views, THE System SHALL preserve authentication state and user context

### Requirement 3: Authentication and Session Management Fix

**User Story:** As a logged-in administrator, I want to access all system areas without being redirected to login, so that I can seamlessly navigate between administrative and user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin is authenticated, THE System SHALL allow access to all routes without login redirects
2. WHEN session validation occurs, THE System SHALL check Funifier authentication status directly
3. WHEN accessing protected routes, THE System SHALL verify admin privileges through Funifier role verification
4. WHEN authentication expires, THE System SHALL provide clear notification and re-authentication options
5. WHEN multiple system areas are accessed, THE System SHALL maintain consistent session state across all interfaces

### Requirement 4: Functional Quick Actions Implementation

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the quick action buttons in the admin panel to perform their intended functions, so that I can efficiently manage system operations and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quick action buttons are clicked, THE System SHALL execute the corresponding administrative functions
2. WHEN system status actions are triggered, THE System SHALL update Funifier configurations and reflect changes immediately
3. WHEN user management actions are performed, THE System SHALL modify user data through Funifier APIs
4. WHEN configuration changes are made via quick actions, THE System SHALL persist changes to Funifier database
5. WHEN quick actions complete, THE System SHALL provide feedback on success or failure of the operation

### Requirement 5: Mock Data Removal and Demo Mode Isolation

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to ensure that mock data only appears in demo mode, so that the production system displays only real Funifier data and maintains data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates in production mode, THE System SHALL display only real data from Funifier APIs
2. WHEN demo mode is active, THE System SHALL use mock data as fallback for demonstration purposes
3. WHEN switching between modes, THE System SHALL clearly indicate the current operational state
4. WHEN mock data is detected outside demo mode, THE System SHALL replace it with Funifier API calls
5. WHEN data validation occurs, THE System SHALL verify that all displayed information comes from legitimate sources

### Requirement 6: Ranking System Data Integration

**User Story:** As a user accessing the ranking system, I want to see real-time ranking data from Funifier, so that the competitive information is accurate and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ranking page loads, THE System SHALL fetch current ranking data directly from Funifier APIs
2. WHEN ranking information is displayed, THE System SHALL show real user positions, points, and competitive metrics
3. WHEN ranking data updates, THE System SHALL reflect changes in real-time or with minimal delay
4. WHEN ranking API calls fail, THE System SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback
5. WHEN ranking filters are applied, THE System SHALL process requests through Funifier ranking endpoints

### Requirement 7: Headless Architecture Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to function as a true headless application, so that all data operations go directly to Funifier without unnecessary internal API layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend components need data, THE System SHALL make direct API calls to Funifier services
2. WHEN data modifications occur, THE System SHALL send requests directly to Funifier endpoints
3. WHEN authentication is required, THE System SHALL use Funifier authentication mechanisms directly
4. WHEN caching is needed, THE System SHALL implement client-side caching strategies
5. WHEN API responses are processed, THE System SHALL handle Funifier response formats directly

### Requirement 8: System State Persistence

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all configuration changes and system modifications to persist properly, so that settings are maintained across sessions and system restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin configurations are modified, THE System SHALL save changes to Funifier database collections
2. WHEN white-label settings are updated, THE System SHALL persist branding and feature configurations
3. WHEN user preferences are changed, THE System SHALL store modifications in Funifier user profiles
4. WHEN system restarts occur, THE System SHALL restore all configurations from Funifier storage
5. WHEN data synchronization is needed, THE System SHALL maintain consistency between local state and Funifier backend

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a system user, I want clear error messages and appropriate fallback behavior when Funifier APIs are unavailable, so that I understand system status and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Funifier APIs are unreachable, THE System SHALL display clear error messages indicating connectivity issues
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded, THE System SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
