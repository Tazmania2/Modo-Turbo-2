# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The white-label gamification platform is a comprehensive solution that unifies the individual dashboard functionality from Essencia with the ranking system from fnp, creating a customizable gamification app powered by Funifier. This platform will provide both end-user functionality (personal dashboards and rankings) and administrative capabilities for white-label customization, allowing organizations to brand and configure the system according to their needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified User Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to access both my personal gamification dashboard and ranking views from a single integrated platform, so that I can have a complete view of my gamification progress and competitive standing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL display both personal dashboard metrics and ranking information
2. WHEN a user clicks the ranking button from their dashboard THEN the system SHALL navigate to the integrated ranking view
3. WHEN a user views their personal dashboard THEN the system SHALL fetch and display their individual goals, points, and boosts from Funifier
4. WHEN a user accesses the ranking system THEN the system SHALL display both global rankings and personalized ranking views
5. IF a user has insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate access restrictions

### Requirement 2: Personalized Ranking System

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to see a personalized ranking dashboard with my avatar, points, position, and contextual ranking information, so that I can understand my standing relative to others around my position.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their ranking dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the race card and ranking list identical to the global view
2. WHEN the system renders the right-side cards THEN it SHALL show the user's personal avatar, points, and current position
3. WHEN displaying contextual rankings THEN the system SHALL show the top 3 users, followed by a divider, then the user above, the current user, and the user below
4. WHEN a user has no adjacent users THEN the system SHALL display available users or appropriate messaging
5. WHEN an admin accesses the global view THEN the system SHALL provide a separate interface for display purposes (TVs, public screens)

### Requirement 3: User History Functionality

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to access my historical data from previous seasons and view performance graphs for the current season, so that I can track my progress and analyze my performance trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their history THEN the system SHALL display data from previous seasons and current season performance graphs
2. WHEN historical season data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show season-specific metrics and achievements
3. WHEN current season graphs are shown THEN the system SHALL display performance trends and progress visualization
4. WHEN historical data is unavailable for a season THEN the system SHALL indicate the missing data period
5. WHEN the system processes history requests THEN it SHALL cache results for improved performance

### Requirement 4: Funifier Data Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to seamlessly integrate with Funifier APIs for both projects, so that all gamification data remains synchronized and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish secure connections to Funifier APIs using configured credentials
2. WHEN user data is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch real-time information from Funifier reports
3. WHEN Funifier API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them within acceptable timeframes
5. WHEN data synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency between dashboard and ranking components

### Requirement 5: Initial System Setup and Demo Mode

**User Story:** As a first-time administrator, I want to either set up Funifier integration or use a demo mode, so that I can evaluate and configure the platform according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is accessed for the first time THEN it SHALL present options for "Demo Mode" or "Set up Funifier"
2. WHEN demo mode is selected THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality with sample data as fallback
3. WHEN Funifier setup is chosen THEN the system SHALL guide through credential configuration and validation
4. WHEN Funifier is successfully configured THEN the system SHALL redirect to admin login requiring Funifier admin role verification
5. WHEN the system is reset via white-label access THEN it SHALL return to the initial setup state

### Requirement 6: Funifier-Based White Label Configuration

**User Story:** As a white-label administrator, I want the system to store and manage white-label configurations through Funifier's database API, so that branding and settings persist and can be managed centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Funifier is configured THEN the system SHALL create a specific collection for white-label data via database API
2. WHEN white-label configurations are saved THEN the system SHALL store them in the Funifier database collection
3. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL fetch white-label settings from the Funifier collection
4. WHEN admin role verification is needed THEN the system SHALL check roles from https://service2.funifier.com/v3/database/principal for "admin" role
5. WHEN no Funifier data is set or by admin choice THEN the system SHALL fallback to demo mode with neutral defaults

### Requirement 7: Headless Architecture Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the unified platform to maintain the headless architecture of both original projects, so that the system remains flexible and can integrate with various front-end implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL return data in consistent JSON format
2. WHEN front-end applications request data THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful API responses
3. WHEN the system processes requests THEN it SHALL maintain separation between data layer and presentation layer
4. WHEN API versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL support backward compatibility
5. WHEN external systems integrate THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation

### Requirement 8: Performance and Loading Experience

**User Story:** As a system user, I want clear feedback when the system is loading data, so that I understand the system is working even when data fetching takes time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches data THEN it SHALL complete within 5 seconds maximum
2. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display an engaging animated loading symbol
3. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
4. WHEN system load increases THEN performance SHALL degrade gracefully without crashes
5. WHEN loading takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators or status updates

### Requirement 9: Security and Access Control

5. WHEN system health is monitored THEN key metrics SHALL be tracked and reported

### Requirement 11: Feature Toggle Management

2. WHEN an administrator chooses to reset THEN the system SHALL provide option to return to neutral defaults
3. WHEN neutral defaults are applied THEN the system SHALL remove all custom branding and return to baseline configuration
