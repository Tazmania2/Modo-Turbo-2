3. WHEN analyzing testing approaches THEN the system SHALL identify new testing patterns, coverage improvements, and validation strategies
4. WHEN reviewing performance optimizations THEN the system SHALL document caching strategies, bundle optimizations, and loading improvements
5. WHEN assessing security measures THEN the system SHALL identify enhanced authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Integration Strategy Development

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to develop a strategy for integrating improvements from the base projects without breaking existing functionality, so that I can ensure a smooth enhancement process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning integration THEN the system SHALL prioritize improvements based on impact, complexity, and compatibility with existing features
2. WHEN designing integration approach THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility with current white-label configurations
3. WHEN planning implementation THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies, potential conflicts, and migration requirements
4. WHEN developing rollback strategy THEN the system SHALL ensure ability to revert changes if integration issues arise
5. WHEN creating testing plan THEN the system SHALL validate that existing functionality remains intact after improvements

### Requirement 5: White-Label Compatibility Assessment

**User Story:** As a white-label administrator, I want to ensure that improvements from base projects are compatible with our white-label customization system, so that existing configurations and branding remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN assessing new features THEN the system SHALL verify they can be controlled through existing feature toggle mechanisms
3. WHEN reviewing configuration changes THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with current white-label storage and management
4. WHEN examining API changes THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility with existing authentication and authorization systems
5. WHEN testing integration THEN the system SHALL verify that existing white-label instances continue to function correctly

### Requirement 6: Performance Impact Analysis

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to understand the performance impact of integrating improvements from base projects, so that I can ensure the platform maintains optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing new features THEN the system SHALL measure their impact on page load times and resource usage
2. WHEN evaluating code changes THEN the system SHALL assess their effect on bundle size and runtime performance
3. WHEN reviewing database operations THEN the system SHALL analyze impact on query performance and data storage
4. WHEN testing API improvements THEN the system SHALL measure response time changes and throughput impact
5. WHEN assessing caching strategies THEN the system SHALL validate improvements in data retrieval and user experience

### Requirement 7: Security Enhancement Evaluation

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want to evaluate security improvements from the base projects, so that I can enhance the security posture of our unified platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing authentication changes THEN the system SHALL identify enhanced login security, session management, and user verification
2. WHEN examining data handling THEN the system SHALL catalog improved input validation, sanitization, and output encoding
3. WHEN analyzing API security THEN the system SHALL identify enhanced rate limiting, request validation, and response filtering
4. WHEN reviewing access control THEN the system SHALL document improved role-based permissions and resource protection
5. WHEN assessing vulnerability mitigation THEN the system SHALL identify new security measures and threat protection mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

**User Story:** As a team member, I want comprehensive documentation of the analysis and integration process, so that I can understand the changes and maintain the improved platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed documentation of identified improvements and their benefits
2. WHEN integration strategy is developed THEN the system SHALL document implementation steps, dependencies, and potential risks
